<strong>Tech used:</strong>

HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


<strong>How It's Made:</strong>


This website was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive, well designed to the client's taste, and interactive.


<strong>Lesson Learned:</strong>

I learned how to link and email or other pages to a different tab. Something simple, but that I didn't really know how to do before, I confess.
